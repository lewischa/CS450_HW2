* exec_test now named exec_launch

* exec_launch handles input/output redirection with '<' and/or '>' and piping
	- single_exec no longer in use, but just commented out for now
	- input and output redirection will likely need some error handling if there is
		a problem opening the input or output file (currently no error handling)

* exec has basic implementation for checking for quoted arguments (not finished)
	- Checks if first char of line_words[i] is '"' 
	- concatenate all succeeding line_words until end quote is found
		* This happens in getQuotedArg() <-- Where I left off
	- Will need to increment argNumber after getting the quoted argument
	- Will need to check if next i is equal to num_words
		* model after following else statement (see comments in code)

* NEW FUNCTIONS:
	- exec_launch, renamed from exec_test
	- isQuote
		* checks if first character of word is '"', return 1 if so, 0 otherwise
	- isEndQuote
		* checks if the last character of a word is '"', return 1 if so, 0 otherwise
	- getQuotedArg
		* concatenate line_words from beginning quote to end quote as a single char*
	- getRedirectedCommand
		* return only the command portion of a command with input and/or output redirection
	- getInfile
		* return input file name when input redirection is present
	- getOutfile  
		* return output file name when output redirection is present
